## Introduction

The paper begins by discussing the increasing incorporation of AI in combat platforms, highlighting its potential to revolutionize decision-making and self-regulation capabilities in military systems. The transformative impact of AI, exemplified by Google's AI beating the world chess champion, underscores the vast potential of this technology in defense applications.

## Concept of Artificial Intelligence

AI has evolved through three major waves:
1. **Handcrafted Knowledge**
2. **Statistical Learning**
3. **Contextual Adaptation**

Each wave has brought improvements and advancements, leading to the complex systems we have today.

## Types of AI

### ü§ñ Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)
ANI involves systems that perform specific tasks by analyzing data, such as weather prediction software. In military applications, ANI is used in tracking and navigation systems, especially in UAVs.

### ü§ñ Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
AGI aims to achieve human-like intelligence, capable of understanding and learning from diverse data sources. An example is Google's DeepMind, an advanced self-learning system.

### ü§ñ Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)
ASI aspires to surpass human intelligence, a concept still in the theoretical phase. Its development could revolutionize all sectors but requires careful consideration due to potential risks.

## Subsystems

### üì° Navigation Systems
AI enhances missile navigation by processing real-time data to accurately track and adjust to moving targets. Examples include heat-seeking missiles improved with AI for better target acquisition.

### üéØ Weapons Targeting Systems
AI-based targeting systems use complex algorithms to handle dynamic combat scenarios, improving the accuracy and efficiency of missile strikes.

### üöÅ Unmanned Systems
AI improves the functionality of UAVs and UGVs, facilitating real-time communication and intelligence gathering. India's Nishant UAV is an example of early AI integration in unmanned systems.

### üîí Cyber Security
AI plays a crucial role in cybersecurity, protecting sensitive military data from breaches. Advanced AI systems can detect and neutralize threats with minimal human intervention.

## Drawbacks

Despite its benefits, AI integration in military systems poses challenges, such as high costs, potential malfunctions in adverse conditions, and ethical concerns about the autonomy of AI in critical decisions.

## Conclusion

AI continues to evolve, offering immense potential for advancements in missile technology and military applications. However, careful research, development, and ethical considerations are essential to harness its full potential safely.
